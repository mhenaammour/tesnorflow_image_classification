# tesnorflow_image_classification
The TensorFlow Image Classification project is an exciting endeavor aimed at leveraging the power of TensorFlow, an open-source machine learning library, to develop a robust image classification system. In this project, we employ deep learning techniques to teach a model how to accurately classify images into predefined categories.
